# Meloweh's altoclef fork

This fork adds some additional features to altoclef.  
You can find the new features in my branch "Meloweh".

# New commands

## - build (WIP)

### Description:

It's the builder process from baritone but the bot will source missing materials by itself.

### Usage:

1.) Ensure that the directory ".minecraft/schematics/" exists  
2.) Place a schematic file in "schematics" that is supported by baritone (As an example "myschem.schem")  
3.) Type `@build myschem.schem` in the chat

### TODO/ISSUES:

- (Unconfirmed) Softlock scenario: Need 1 cobble, mine straight down, find one, tries to stack up with the same cobble to attempt to get out of the hole, repeat
- (Unconfirmed) Softlock scenario: Want to go to roof of schematic, stacks up in the schematic zone with random blocks but tries to remove those since mostly air is wanted at those positions, repeat.
- ~~There is yet another crafting softlock in default altoclef that breaks the builder~~
- (Unconfirmed) There is a similar soft lock in the furnace task like the one I fixed in update alpha.3
- It can occur that after a while the builder task repeats to collect more materials after just one block was placed
- Anti mine protection zones are not seperated by world
- Anti mine protection zones are not seperated by dimension
- Unsupported blocks should become support but until then they be ignored
- ~~Sitting in a pit can cause a stackoverflow in the recursion of InventoryTracker.hasIngredientInAnyDepth~~

## - Autofill (WIP)

### Description:

Allows you to choose a chest and let the bot source and fill it with stuff you have specified.

### Usage:

1.) Look at a chest so that it is selected by the cursor block selection  
2.) Type `@autofill dirt` for an example

### TODO:

If the inventory is full then non throwaway materials should be stored in a chest either somewhere around or in a
base.

### ISSUES:

- ~~Crash if no item specified in command~~
- ~~Crash if non existing item specified~~

## - Roundtrip

### Description:

Allows you to do tasks and return where you started.
It also allows you to create and save macros out of altoclef commands. That means you can queue a chain of tasks.

### Usage:

- `@roundtrip` queues a new milestone

  #### Example:

  `@roundtrip get coal 3`

  Now a milestone has been added to the queued chain

- `@roundtrip start` executes the queued chain

  #### Example:

  `@roundtrip get coal 3`  
  `@roundtrip get oak_log 2`  
  `@roundtrip build myschem.schem`
  `@roundtrip start`

  Now the bot will first collect 3 coal, then 2 oak_log and then it tries to build the schematic myschem.schem.

- `@roundtrip stop` stops execution of the queued chain
- `@roundtrip clear` clears the queued chain
- `@roundtrip reset` stops and clears the queued chain
- `@roundtrip list` prints the queue
- `@roundtrip push` pushes a new command to the macro queue

  #### Example:

  `@roundtrip push get coal 3`

  Now task `get coal 3` has been added to the macro queue

- `@roundtrip flushas` will save the current macro queue and flushes memory

  #### Example:

  `@roundtrip push get coal 3`
  `@roundtrip push get oak_log 2`
  `@roundtrip push build myschem.schem`
  `@roundtrip flushas myCoolMacro`

  Now you can let the bot do the exact same thing like in the first @roundtrip example by just typing:  
  `@roundtrip myCoolMacro`

- `@roundtrip flush` removes all pushed macros from memory
- `@roundtrip remove` removes a saved macro from the hard drive

  #### Example:

  `@roundtrip remove myCoolMacro`

  Now a macro that was named myCoolMacro will be removed from the hard drive
